# CSGO_game_parser

This repo is intended as a waste of time while I have nothing else to do.
This program reads CS:GO competitive data from a locally saved html file by dragging the html file onto the program icon.

# Usage
1. Get all data by following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/8mbtjx/how_to_check_your_personal_game_data_for_banned/) guide.
2. hit ctrl+s and save the page, if presented with the option choose "just HTML"
3. pull the saved html onto the program icon, wait a bit and see some useless data.

If you want more useless data, implement it yourself in `doMathMagic(List<Game> games)` or wherever you see fit.
I may or may not add more things such as timezone support, steamid support and personal player data.
